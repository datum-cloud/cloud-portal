OrganizationMembership establishes a user's membership in an organization and
optionally assigns roles to grant permissions. The controller automatically
manages PolicyBinding resources for each assigned role, simplifying access
control management.

Key features:
  - Establishes user-organization relationship
  - Automatic PolicyBinding creation and deletion for assigned roles
  - Supports multiple roles per membership
  - Cross-namespace role references
  - Detailed status tracking with per-role reconciliation state

Prerequisites:
  - User resource must exist
  - Organization resource must exist
  - Referenced Role resources must exist in their respective namespaces

Example - Basic membership with role assignment:

	apiVersion: resourcemanager.miloapis.com/v1alpha1
	kind: OrganizationMembership
	metadata:
	  name: jane-acme-membership
	  namespace: organization-acme-corp
	spec:
	  organizationRef:
	    name: acme-corp
	  userRef:
	    name: jane-doe
	  roles:
	  - name: organization-viewer
	    namespace: organization-acme-corp

Related resources:
  - User: The user being granted membership
  - Organization: The organization the user joins
  - Role: Defines permissions granted to the user
  - PolicyBinding: Automatically created by the controller for each role

# Dashboard explained

[Staging grafana dashboard](https://grafana.staging.env.datum.net/d/deicyjvtfy800e/cloud-portal?orgId=1&from=now-3h&to=now&timezone=browser&var-pod=$__all&var-resolution=30s&var-query0=1m&var-interval=1m)

## Memory use

![..](./assets/dashboard/memory.png)

The chart display the following stacked information:

- nodejs_heap_size_used_bytes: Shows how much memory is actually used by V8‚Äôs JS heap.
- nodejs_heap_size_total_bytes: Allocated heap (might be larger than used)
- nodejs_heap_size_limit_bytes: V8 limit (based on --max-old-space-size)
- nodejs_external_memory_bytes: Memory used by ‚Äúexternal‚Äù resources ‚Äî things allocated by C++ bindings, like Buffers and other native modules.

  This is non-JavaScript memory ‚Äî it‚Äôs memory allocated by native code but linked to JS objects so the garbage collector still knows about them.

  Common sources:

  - Buffer objects (e.g. Buffer.alloc(10000))
  - Native modules written in C/C++\*
  - WebAssembly, or bindings to native libraries (e.g. ffi, sqlite3, image/video processors)
  - Sometimes libraries using node-gyp or N-API

  This is tracked, because V8‚Äôs garbage collector needs to have some awareness of how much memory your app is using ‚Äî even if it didn‚Äôt allocate it directly.

  It doesn‚Äôt manage external memory, but it will slow down allocations or trigger GC sooner if external_memory is high ‚Äî to help avoid total memory blowups.

## Open File Descriptors

![.](./assets/dashboard/file-descriptors.png)

This graph show `open_handles_total`, which is especially useful when you‚Äôre dealing with:

- Leaking file handles
- Forgotten sockets
- Hanging HTTP requests
- Unclosed streams, timers, or DB connections

If this number steadily increases over time ‚Äî and doesn‚Äôt drop ‚Äî it usually means resources are being created but not cleaned up.

How to interpret it

Flat or spiky Normal (e.g., requests coming in, getting cleaned up)
Steady upward slope üö® Potential leak (open handles are accumulating)
High value without traffic Suspicious ‚Äî something may be stuck

What are file descriptors?

File Descriptors (FDs) = Handles to ‚Äúthings‚Äù

They‚Äôre numbers the OS gives to your process to represent open resources like:

- Files Opened with fs.open() or fs.createWriteStream()
- Sockets HTTP requests, WebSockets, etc.
- Pipes Between processes
- Timers setInterval, setTimeout (these keep the event loop alive)
- Streams File or network streams
- DB connections Pools not properly released

Each of these uses a file descriptor under the hood. They‚Äôre finite ‚Äî open too many and you hit EMFILE (too many open files)

## Red flags:

- heap_size_used climbs steadily over hours/days ‚Üí potential JS leak.
- external_memory_bytes grows ‚Üí possible Buffer or native addon leak.
- resident_memory_bytes grows faster than JS heap ‚Üí could be native, file descriptors, threads, or other OS-level leaks.
